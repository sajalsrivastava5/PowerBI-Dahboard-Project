# PowerBI-Dashboard-Project

**Data Collection:**

Gathered historical employee data, including information about employees who left the company, such as their names, departure dates, and employee IDs.

Collected sales and revenue data for the corresponding time periods, ensuring you have a common identifier (e.g., employee ID) to link this data to the employees.

****Data Preparation:**

Cleaned and preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, standardizing employee names and IDs, and aggregating sales and revenue data by employees.

**Data Integration:**

Combined the employee data with the sales and revenue data using a common identifier.

**Feature Engineering:**

Create relevant features like tenure (time spent at the company) for each employee.

**Data Visualization:**

Developed a Power BI dashboard with various visualizations, including:

Bar charts or histograms to show the distribution of sales and revenue among employees who left.

Line charts to track sales and revenue trends over time for employees before they left.

Heatmaps or scatter plots to explore potential correlations between tenure and sales/revenue.

Pie charts or donut charts to display the proportion of sales and revenue attributed to different employees.

**Segmentation:**

Segmented the employees who left into different categories.

**Advanced Analytics:**

Considered this using advanced analytics techniques like predictive modeling or clustering to identify patterns or predict future employee departures and their potential impact on sales and revenue.

**Interactivity:**

Ensured that the Power BI dashboard allows for user interactivity, such as filtering by date range or employee attributes

**Documentation:**

Documented the data sources, data transformations, and the rationale behind your visualizations and insights for future reference.

**Presentation:**

Prepared a presentation summarizing your findings and the actionable insights derived from the HR analytics project. Share this with the relevant stakeholder.
